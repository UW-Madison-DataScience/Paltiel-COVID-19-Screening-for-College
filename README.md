## Brief disclaimer

This dashboard is **not** implemented by the original authors of the paper, and we cannot guarantee that the methodology is implemented exactly as the paper.  We have made extensive checks against a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otD4h-DpmAmh4dUAM4favTjbsly3t5z-OXOtFSbF1lY) mentioned in the original paper, which now links directly to our dashbaord.
